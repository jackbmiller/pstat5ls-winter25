# Lab Code

Use the chunks below to try out any code that you'd like. Run the code chunk below to load the `penguins` data set so you can try things out with this data set.

```{r loadPenguins, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to load the penguins data set into the environment
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to peek at the penguins data set


```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to examine the structure of the penguins data set


```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to get help with the hist function


```

```{r tryIt4, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to view the summary of the flipper_length_mm variable in the penguins data
summary(penguins$flipper_length_mm)

```

```{r tryIt5, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to have R give you the standard deviation of the flipper_length_mm variable in the penguins data in addition to the other summary statistics (you'll need two lines of code, one for the summary statistics and one for the standard deviation)


```

```{r tryIt6, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to get all of the specific number summary values
min(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
median(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
max(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
sd(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
IQR(penguins$flipper_length_mm)
# Note that IQR is in all capital letters. Anything else (e.g., `iqr(penguins$flipper_length_mm)`) would give you an error

```

```{r tryIt7, error = T}
# Replace the "your title here" and "your axis label here" for the x-axis (xlab) in the code chunk below and then run this code chunk. 
# Watch out for the dreaded typos! If you get an error message, try to debug it yourself before asking for help!
# When you make your own histograms, be sure to add the `main` and `xlab` labels for better readability 
hist(penguins$flipper_length_mm,
     main = "your title here",
     xlab = "your axis label here",
     col = "lightblue")

```

```{r tryIt8, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to make a box plot of the variable flipper_length_mm in the penguins data. Don't forget a title using `main` and a y-axis label using `ylab`.


```

```{r tryIt9, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to make a side-by-side boxplot of penguins body mass by the categorical variable `species`
boxplot(penguins$bill_length_mm ~ penguins$species,
        main = "Box Plots of Penguin Bill Length by Species",
        ylab = "Bill Length (mm)",
        xlab = "Species",
        col = c("darkorange1", "mediumorchid2", "darkcyan"))

```

# R Code Cheat Sheet

## `<-`
- Assigns a value to a name
- `name <- value`

## `$`
- tells R that we are looking for a variable in a particular data frame
- `data_set_name$data_set_variable`

## `summary(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`
- creates the five number summary of a numeric variable

## `hist(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`
- creates a histogram of a numeric variable

## `boxplot(data_set_name$data_set_variable)`
- creates a boxplot of a numeric variable

## `boxplot(data_set_name$numeric_variable ~ data_set_name$categorical_variable)`
- creates side-by-side boxplots of a numeric variable grouped by a categorical variable

## Important plotting arguments

### `main = "Title of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- graph title that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `xlab = "x-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- the x- (horizontal) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `ylab = "y-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- the y- (vertical) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes
