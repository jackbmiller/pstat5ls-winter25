## Healthy Body Temperatures

The standard healthy human body-temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit was made famous by German physician Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich, who published the figure in a book in 1868. Modern studies, however, have called that number into question, suggesting that it's too high.

A medical research team at Stanford led by Julie Parsonnet, MD, compiled a data set of body temperature measurements from adult patients who visited Stanford Health Care between 2007 and 2017 to examine this question.[^1] In this question, we'll be looking at a randomly selected subset of 100 of those measurements. It was determined that these Stanford patients are a good representation of adults across the entire United States.

## Read in the Data

Run the code in chunk below to read in the data.

```{r readData, error = T}
bodyTemps <- read.csv("body_temp_100.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

## Examine a Histogram of the Temperatures

The first step in analyzing data is to make a graphical display. Use the following chunk to create a histogram of the body temperatures (`bodyTemps$temp`). Be sure to add a title and axis label. 

```{r hist, error = T}





```

## Calculate the Summary Statistics

Use the following code chunk to calculate summary statistics, including the standard deviation, for the temperatures.

```{r summary_stats, error = T}




```

## Have R Run the Hypothesis Test

Use the following code chunk to have R run the test research team’s claim that the mean body temperature for healthy humans has decreased from 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r HT, error = T}



```
