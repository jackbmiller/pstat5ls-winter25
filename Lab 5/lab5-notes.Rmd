```{r loadPenguins, error = T}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

```{r tryit1, error = T}
# Run this chunk to have R create a subset with only the Adelie and Chinstrap penguins
penguinsSubset <- subset(penguins,
                         species %in% c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"))
```

```{r tryit2, error = T}
# Run this chunk to have R create a histogram of the flipper lengths of the Adelie penguins
hist(penguinsSubset$flipper_length_mm[penguinsSubset$species == "Adelie"],
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Lengths of Adelie Penguins",
     xlab = "Flipper Length in mm", 
     col = "darkorange1")

```

```{r tryit3, error = T}
# Make the appropriate changes to this chunk to have R create a histogram of the flipper lengths of the Chinstrap penguins
hist(penguinsSubset$flipper_length_mm[penguinsSubset$species == "Adelie"],
     main = "Histogram of Flipper Lengths of Adelie Penguins",
     xlab = "Flipper Length in mm", 
     col = "darkorange1")

```

```{r tryit4, error = T}
# Make sure to specify the alternative in the `alternative` argument ("two.sided", "less", "greater") before running this chunk
t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ species,
       data = penguinsSubset,
       alternative = )

```

```{r tryit5, error = T}
# Make sure to specify the confidence level as a decimal before running this chunk 
t.test(flipper_length_mm ~ species,
       data = penguinsSubset,
       conf.level = )

```

```{r tryit6, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to read in birth.csv and call it babies

```

```{r tryit7, error = T}
# Type in code below to look at the structure of the `babies` data set


```

```{r tryit8, error = T}
# Add the code to calculate a new variable called `ageDiff` in the babies data set and then run this chunk. Don't forget that R needs you to specify the variables in dataset$variable format
babies$ageDiff <- 

```

```{r tryit9, error = T}
# Specify our new variable for the differences below and then run this code chunk to create a histogram of the ageDiff variable
hist( ,

     of Babies Born in North Carolina in 2004",
     xlab = "Difference of Age in Years", 
     col = "lightgreen")
```

```{r tryit10, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to create a 90% confidence interval for the ageDiff variable


```

```{r tryit11, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to run a hypothesis test for the ageDiff variable

Curious to learn more about formatting math in RMarkdown? More or less, RMarkdown and Knitr use LaTeX formatting (pronounced "LAY-tech" or "LAH-tech") to produce math characters and expression, so most guides you read on typesetting math in LaTeX will also apply to Rmd. If you're interested (and to be clear, this is not required for any part of the course), I'd check out [this tutorial from Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) first. And here is a [pretty extensive cheatsheet for symbols](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf). 

# Code Cheat Sheet

## `pt(q, df, lower.tail = TRUE)`

- `q` is the x-axis value you want to find an area related to
- `df` is the degrees of freedom of the $t$ distribution
- `lower.tail` determines whether `pt()` finds the area to the left or right of `q`. If `lower.tail = TRUE` (the default), it shades to the left. If `lower.tail = FALSE`, it shades to the right.
  
## `qt(q, df, lower.tail = TRUE)`

- `p` is the probability or area under the curve you want to find an x-axis value for
- `df` is the degrees of freedom of the $t$ distribution
- `lower.tail` determines whether `pt()` finds the area to the left or right of `q`. If `lower.tail = TRUE` (the default), it shades to the left. If `lower.tail = FALSE`, it shades to the right.
  
## `plot_t()`

- `df` refers to the degrees of freedom of the distribution to plot. You must provide this value.
- `shadeValues` is a vector of up to 2 numbers that define the region you want to shade
- `direction` can be one of `less`, `greater`, `beyond`, or `between`, and controls the direction of shading between `shadeValues`. Must be `less` or `greater` if `shadeValues` has only one element; `beyond` or `between` if two
- `col.shade` controls the color of the shaded region, defaults to `"cornflowerblue"`
- `...` lets you specify other graphical parameters to control the appearance of the normal curve (e.g., `lwd`, `lty`, `col`, etc.)

## `t.test(x, alternative, mu, conf.level)`
- `x` is a vector of data values
- `alternative` specifies the direction of the alternative hypothesis; must be one of "two.sided", "less", or "greater"
- `mu` indicates the true value of the mean (under the null hypothesis); defaults to 0
- `conf.level` is the confidence level to be used in constructing a confidence interval; must be between 0 and 1, defaults to 0.95

## Important plotting arguments

### `main = "Title of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- graph title that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `xlab = "x-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- the x- (horizontal) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `ylab = "y-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`

- the y- (vertical) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes
