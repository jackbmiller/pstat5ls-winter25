# Lab Tutorial

```{r setSeed, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(734)
```

```{r tryIt1, error = T}
# Enter values for `chanceSuccess`, `numDraws`, and `numRepetitions` below and then run this chunk (be sure to run the `setSeed` chunk above before you run this one)
sim1 <- simulate_chance_model(chanceSuccess =  , 
                              numDraws =  , 
                              numRepetitions =  )
```

```{r tryIt2, error = T}
# Enter values for `v` to have R draw the vertical lines showing where unusual values lie in the histogram of the 2000 repetitions of the simulation. Then run this chunk to create the histogram
hist(sim1, 
     main = "Histogram of 2000 Simulation Results",
     xlab = "Simulated Proportion of U.S. Households with at Least One Pet")
abline(v =  , col = "red")
abline(v =  , col = "red")
```

```{r tryIt3, error = T}
total <- sum(sim1 <= 0.672) + sum(sim1 >= 0.728)  
estimated_pvalue <- total/2000
estimated_pvalue

```

```{r, tryIt4, error = T}
# Enter values for `p_0` and `n` below and then run this code chunk to compute the standard error for the normal distribution
p_0 <- 
n <- 
SE <- sqrt(p_0*(1 - p_0)/n)
SE 
```

```{r, tryIt5, error = T}
# Enter values for `mean` and `sd` below and then run this code chunk to visualize the p-value for the hypothesis test
plot_norm(mean =  , 
          sd =  , 
          shadeValues = c(0.672, 0.728), 
          direction = "beyond", 
          col.shade = "darkgreen")
```

```{r, tryIt6, error = T}
# Enter values for `x`, `n`, `p`, and `alternative` ("less", "two.sided", "greater" with the quotation marks) below and then run this code chunk 
prop_test(x =  , 
          n =  , 
          p =  , 
          alternative =  )
```

```{r tryIt7, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to get the p-value for the two-sided test
2 * pnorm(q = 0.672, 
      mean = 0.70, 
      sd = 0.0167, 
      lower.tail = TRUE)
```

```{r tryIt8, error = T}
# Enter the `conf.level` and then run this chunk to have R create a 98% confidence interval
prop_test(x = 504, 
          n = 750,
          conf.level =  )
```

# Code Cheat Sheet

## `set.seed(seed)`
Sets the "seed" of R's random number generator. After setting the seed, the sequence of random numbers R will produce is entirely determined/predictable. This is useful for ensuring you get the same results whenever you knit your code.

- `seed` is an integer. The seed you want to set.

## `simulate_chance_model(chanceSuccess, numDraws, numRepetitions)`

- `chanceSuccess`: a number between 0 and 1 represending the probability of observing a "success"
- `numDraws`: the number of times to draw a poker chip from the bag needed to coplete one repetition of the simulation
- `numRepetitions`: the number of times to repeat the simulation process

## `abline(linear_model_name)`

- Will plot the line found in `linear_model_name`
- Use `v = value` to print a vertical line

## `plot_norm()` 

- `mean`: the mean of the normal distribution you'd like to draw ($\mu$)
- `sd`: the standard deviation or standard error of the normal distribution you'd like to draw ($\sigma$ or $\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}$, respectively)
- `shadeValues` (optional): either a number or a vector of two numbers (using `c()`) that are the boundaries of the region you'd like to shade.
- `direction`: where to shade (`"less"`, `"greater"`, `"between"`, or `"beyond"`)
- `col.shade`: the color to use when shading
- any other graphical parameters you want to use to control the appearance of the plot (like `main`, etc.)

## `prop_test(x, n, p, alternative)`

- `x`: the number of successes observed in the study
- `n`: the sample size of the study
- `p`: the value of the null hypothesis
- `alternative`: the direction of the alternative hypothesis; choices are `"two.sided"` (default), `"greater"`, or `"less"`

## `pnorm(q, mean, sd, lower.tail = TRUE)`

- `q`: the x-axis value you want to find an area related to
- `mean`: the mean of the normal distribution, defaults to 0
- `sd`: the standard deviation of the normal distribution, defaults to 1
- `lower.tail` determines whether `pnorm()` finds the area to the left or right of `q`. If `lower.tail` is set to \textcolor{blue}{`TRUE`} (the default), it shades to the \textcolor{blue}{LEFT} If `lower.tail` is set to \textcolor{red}{`FALSE`}, it shades to the \textcolor{red}{RIGHT}.

## Important plotting arguments

### `main = "Title of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- graph title that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `xlab = "x-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- the x- (horizontal) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes

### `ylab = "y-axis Label of Your Graph in Double Quotes"`
- the y- (vertical) axis label that must be inside a set of double quotes
