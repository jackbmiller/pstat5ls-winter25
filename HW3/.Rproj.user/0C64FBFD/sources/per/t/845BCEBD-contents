# Don't Forget to Rename your Document

To avoid your work being overwritten, **rename** this file (`hw3.Rmd`). You could add your name to the file name (e.g., `hw3-profmiller.Rmd`).

# Introduction

In 2018, 59\% of adults in the United States said that there are too few women in top executive business positions. Has the rate changed? Recently, researchers found that 663 of 1200 U.S. adults surveyed said that there are too few women in top executive business positions.

# Run the Simulation

```{r setSeed, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to set the seed so that your results match what your TA is expecting. 
set.seed(941)

```

```{r runSim, error = T}
# Fill in the values for chanceSuccess, numDraws, and numRepetitions below to have R run 1000 repetitions of the simulation. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).
sim2 <- simulate_chance_model(chanceSuccess =  , 
                              numDraws =  , 
                              numRepetitions =  )

```

```{r simHist, error = T}
# Run this code chunk to create a histogram of the chance model with lines to indicate the cutoff for values that are as unusual as or more unusual than our sample results. 
nullValue <- 0.59
phat <- 663/1200
hist(sim2,
     main = "Histogram of Simulated Proportions Under H0",
     xlab = "Simulated Proportions")
abline(v = nullValue - abs(phat - nullValue), col = "red")
abline(v = nullValue + abs(phat - nullValue), col = "red")

```

```{r pvalue, error = T}
# This code chunk contains options for you to calculate the p-value. Uncomment (remove the # at the beginning of the line) the code that will calculate the p-value for your alternative hypothesis. Then run this code chunk. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

#Uncomment the following line if you had a less than alternative hypothesis
#sum(sim2 <= phat) / 1000

#Uncomment the following line if you had a two-sided alternative hypothesis
#sum(sim2 <= nullValue - abs(phat - nullValue)) / 1000 + sum(sim2 >= nullValue + abs(phat - nullValue)) / 1000

#Uncomment the following line if you had a greater than alternative hypothesis
#sum(sim2 >= phat) / 1000

```

### Submission instructions

```{=html}
<!-- This is a comment and will not show up in your document. Note that the
numbering here is all 1's. This will automatically be converted to 1, 2, etc.
when you knit the document; writing all 1's makes it so you don't have to
constantly update the numbering when you move things around in editing! -->
